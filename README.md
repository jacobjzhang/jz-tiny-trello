# Jacob's Tiny-Trello App

This is my Tiny-Trello project. I hope you enjoy it. I primarily used Ember components and tried to decouple functionality as much as possible. I hope you find my code clean and understandable. Please be sure to try running tests with 'ember test'. Cheers and thank you for the opportunity!
